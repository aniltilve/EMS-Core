# Angel-Romero-Construction
This is a portfolio website I designed for our home remodeller, Angel Romero. This is my first major web development project.

## Project Implementation
The website is implemented in ASP.NET MVC. The website layout is rendered in cshtml (HTML with embedable C# code), with Boostrap used for the core structure. Data is stored on a database managed by SQL Server, and is manipulated via object-relation mapping thanks to the Entity Framework and LINQ.
